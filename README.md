# Revolution Rails

A small pack which focuses on trains and early 1900s industrial feels, with typical lifestyle difficulties and a beautiful world to explore.

- Lightweight pack suitable for smaller machines
- Shorter playthrough than previous packs
- Single tech stack
- Limit mods and resources to that early 1900s look and feel
- Lots of challenge and difficulty
